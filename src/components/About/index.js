                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Gabriel and I am activily seeking a software development position. I just completed my Full-Stack Bootcamp at UC Berkeley where I developed front-end applications from scratch and worked on several full-stack projects.</p>
                <p>Over the past few months of intense learning, I have improved my web development skills and feel more empowered than ever. I will work hard to fill the remaining gaps and fulfill my goal of becoming the best developer I can possibly be.</p>
                <p>I have an IT background and professional exposure to the software development process. This exposure consists of, but is not limited to; building customizable, templated sites for apartment communities, updating code/adding new features to already existing applications and QA testing for over a hundred mobile apps.</p>
