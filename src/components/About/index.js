                <p>My name is Gabriel, and I am seeking a full-stack development position. My background is originally in IT, but I have had professional exposure to the development process. This exposure consists of, but is not limited to; building customizable, templated sites for apartment communities, updating code/adding new features to already existing applications and QA testing for over a hundred mobile apps.</p>
                <p>I have just finished attending the UC Berkeley Full-Stack Bootcamp and have developed front-end applications from scratch as well as worked on several full-stack projects. With regards to my full-stack skills, I still have room for improvement, but over these past few months learning at my bootcamp I feel more powerful than ever. I will work hard to fill those gaps and fulfill my goal of becoming the best developer I can possibly be.</p>
